# Quasar Documentation

Welcome to the Quasar docs. This site captures how to run, extend, and operate the automated trading platform, along with API reference material generated from the codebase.

## Quick start

- Install docs tooling: `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`
- Live preview: `mkdocs serve -f docs/mkdocs.yml`
- Build site: `mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml`

## What’s inside

- Architecture overview and service guides (DataHub, Registry, Web)
- Autogenerated API reference from Python docstrings via mkdocstrings
- Conventions for writing docstrings and contributing docs
- Versioned publishing instructions with `mike`

## Keeping docs healthy

- Update docs in the same PR as code changes.
- Keep docstrings up to date; mkdocstrings will surface them automatically.
- Run `mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml` locally or in CI before merging.
